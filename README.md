# falafel

Falafel is supposed to be a slightly opinionated open source template for small restaurant businesses/food trucks and such.  

The end goal is to create a template for ordering products from your phone, or a store tablet, like they have at places like Mc. Donald's, Los Tacos etc. 

The name and idea comes from the fact that my favorite falafel place (Jamal's Falafel) does not have this feature,  
and it would be cool to maybe enable some smaller businesses to be able to offer this feature as well.

## Frontend
I will also most likely create a frontend as well, possibly a demo project.

## Application design  
As I usually do with my personal projects, I like to be a bit overkill with my design patterns (because its fun).  
This time I am playing around with some adapter patterns and such. I also write my code without any local variable  
declarations. This is purely for fun, and I will not apologize for it.
